# Technologies Used

This Flutter application template leverages a set of modern and robust technologies to provide a solid foundation for development.

## 1. Flutter

-   **Framework**: [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
-   **Purpose**: Google's UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

## 2. State Management: `flutter_riverpod`

-   **Package**: [`flutter_riverpod`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_riverpod)
-   **Code Generation**: [`riverpod_generator`](https://pub.dev/packages/riverpod_generator)
-   **Purpose**: A reactive caching and data-binding framework that makes state management simple, safe, and testable. `riverpod_generator` automates the creation of Riverpod providers, reducing boilerplate.

## 3. Backend: Firebase

Firebase provides a comprehensive suite of backend services used in this template.

-   **Core**: [`firebase_core`](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_core)
    -   **Purpose**: The main Flutter plugin for Firebase, required for all other Firebase services.
-   **Authentication**: [`firebase_auth`](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_auth)
    -   **Purpose**: Provides services for user authentication, including email/password, social logins, and more.
-   **Cloud Firestore**: [`cloud_firestore`](https://pub.dev/packages/cloud_firestore)
    -   **Purpose**: A flexible, scalable NoSQL cloud database for mobile, web, and server development. It enables real-time data synchronization.
-   **Cloud Storage**: [`firebase_storage`](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_storage)
    -   **Purpose**: A powerful, simple, and cost-effective object storage service built for Google scale. Used for storing user-generated content like profile pictures.

## 4. Routing: `go_router`

-   **Package**: [`go_router`](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router)
-   **Purpose**: A declarative routing package for Flutter that uses the new Router API. It simplifies navigation, handles deep linking, and supports complex routing scenarios like nested navigation and redirects.

## 5. Data Models: `freezed`

-   **Package**: [`freezed_annotation`](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed_annotation)
-   **Code Generation**: [`freezed`](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed)
-   **Purpose**: A code generator for data classes in Dart. It helps create immutable classes with value equality, copyWith methods, and JSON serialization/deserialization, reducing manual boilerplate and potential errors.
-   **Utility**: [`equatable`](https://pub.dev/packages/equatable)
    -   **Purpose**: Often used with `freezed` (though `freezed` handles equality itself for generated classes), `equatable` simplifies equality comparisons for Dart objects.

## 6. Build Automation: `build_runner`

-   **Package**: [`build_runner`](https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner)
-   **Purpose**: A powerful tool for generating code in Dart projects. It orchestrates code generation for packages like `freezed`, `riverpod_generator`, and `json_serializable`, ensuring that generated files are always up-to-date with your source code.

## 7. Linting: `custom_lint` & `riverpod_lint`

-   **Packages**: [`custom_lint`](https://pub.dev/packages/custom_lint), [`riverpod_lint`](https://pub.dev/packages/riverpod_lint)
-   **Purpose**: These packages provide custom lint rules to enforce best practices and catch common errors, especially when working with Riverpod. They help maintain code quality and consistency.
